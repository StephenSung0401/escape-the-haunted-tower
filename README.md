## Instructions of the Game
**GOAL: Escape the haunted tower! Find the exit in the tower in order to be free. Also try to discover different endings of the game!**

Use arrow key to control the movement of the character.

When the character approaches the monster in the map, the character fights with the monster. Either the monster is killed, or you are not able to beat the monster.

Open the door by going towards the door with the corresponding colored key.

Take the resources around different corners of the map in order to increase the character's abilities(e.g. attack, defense, HP, etc.)

When the character goes to the next floor for the **FIRST** time, he will be upgraded, with the abilities increased.
